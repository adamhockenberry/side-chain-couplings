# side-chain-couplings
This repository is for a forthcoming PeerJ manuscript (accepted, link to be added upon publication). 

The most important thing to note is that the `Data` folder is not included here due to size restrictions. So in order to do more than look at / read through the code, users are required to [download the data archive from Zenodo](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2552779). 

There might be a few minor modifications to the code that will be necessary just to get directory structures to pair up nicely after you download and unzip the data. My standard format is to have a `Code` (already here), `Data` and `Results` directory here in the project home so all code is written and presumed to follow this structure.

The manuscript should resolve any technical questions and this code should be complete, but if users have any issues replicating results they should feel free to contact me via email.
